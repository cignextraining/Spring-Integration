- **Routers** direct messages to an appropriate message channel typically based on what is in the payload or header of a message.
- Routers do not alter the message like a transformer. Routers donâ€™t remove messages from the system like a filter can.
- They simply provide forks in the road of message channels in a Spring Integration (SI) application.

### **Content Routers**
  
- Examine incoming message content to determine destination of message.
- Uses payload type or header value to determine route.
  
  <br/>
      
### **Recipient List Routers**
  
- Incoming messages are delivered to all listed recipient channels.
- Don't examine the message.
